@section Sensor configuration

See also @xref{Configuration}. Configuration items for sensors are
@verbatim
[devices]
count=<number of sensors>

[device<sensor number starting at 0>]
type=<sensor type>
name=<configurable friendly name for sensor>
connection_string=<connection>
enable_logging=<whether to enable a device log for this sensor>
max_log_files=<maximum number of log files for this device>
use_as_time_source=<synchronize clock with this device>
enabled=<whether to enable this device>
@end verbatim

The @code{connection_string} determines how to connect to the device. For a USB connection
it is either <VENDOR_ID>:<PRODUCT_ID> or <VENDOR_ID>:<PRODUCT_ID>,<INTERFACE_NO>. 
For a serial connection, the connection string is <SERIAL_DEVICE>:<BAUDRATE>
A valueof @code{auto} for connection string will guess the connection string from default values.
Inspect the daemon/service log file for connection failures.

@subsection NEO-M8U

This is a GNSS device with dead-reckoning. It combines an M8 GPS/GLONASS/Beidou/Galileo capable GNSS chip with an accelerometer and gyro that enables the chip to update its position even during short periods of signal loss as well as provide the orientation of a vehicle. 
Orientation values provided by this device are with respect to the vehicle and therefore require the sensor to have been fixed to the vehicle in a fixed position for some time for these values to be reasonably well calibrated. Alternatively, use a fusion processor to get the orientation with respect to the principle axes of the sensor itself.
