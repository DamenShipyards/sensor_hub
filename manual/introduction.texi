This is the user manual for Sensor Hub. 

Sensor Hub is a service/daemon for collecting and redistributing sensor data. Currently the only sensor supported 
is the Xsens MTi-G-710. @ref{HTTP} and @ref{Modbus} services are available for redistribution of the data.

The main goal of Sensor Hub is to provide a universal uniform interface to sensors by abstracting away the details of
individual sensor types. Only the quantities retrieved from sensors matter and these are provided to external applications
through a simple REST API and a modbus server.

Data is acquired from @ref{Sensors} via some IO interface (e.g. USB or serial port). 
@ref{Processors} can be configured to process the raw data from the sensor. 
This processed data is also made avaible through the HTTP and Modbus services.
